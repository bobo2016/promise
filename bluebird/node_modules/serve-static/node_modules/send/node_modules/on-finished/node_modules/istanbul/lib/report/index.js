/**
 * An abstraction for producing coverage reports.
 * This class is both the base class as well as a factory for `Report` implementations.
 * All reports are event emitters and are expected to emit a `done` event when
 * the report writing is complete.
 *
 * See also the `Reporter` class for easily producing multiple coverage reports
 * with a single call.
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 *
 *      var Report = require('istanbul').Report,
 *          report = Report.create('html'),
 *          collector = new require('istanbul').Collector;
 *
 *      collector.add(coverageObject);
 *      report.on('done', function () { console.log('done'); });
 *      report.writeReport(collector);
